				<p id="p1">Beer</p>
				<div class="text">Beer is the world's most widely consumed and probably the oldest alcoholic beverage; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsâ€”most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used.

				<p id="p2">Cider</p>
				<div class="text">Cider, known as hard cider in North America, is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of apples.The juice of any variety of apple can be used to make cider, but cider apples are best. The addition of sugar or extra fruit before a second fermentation increases the alcoholic content of the resulting beverage.

				<p id="p3">Wine</p>
				<div class="text">Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes, generally Vitis vinifera or its hybrids with Vitis labrusca or Vitis rupestris. Grapes ferment without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients, as yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine.
